# certification_data_analysis

## This repository contains code that is used to answer the following data questions about police employment history data obtained from state police training and certification boards across the U.S:

1. How far back does the data go?
2. How many currently-active officers have had 3+ employers? 5+? More?
3. How many currently-active officers were previously listed as having been fired or terminated?
4. For officers who were previously terminated, and/or officers who have 3/5+ former employers, are there agencies where they seem to end up more often than not?
